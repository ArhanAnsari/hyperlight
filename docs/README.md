Hyperlight is a SDK for running isolated workloads without the overhead of a full guest operating system.
The goal is to consume fewer host resources, and reduce workload startup latency.

<!-- TODO: Define the scope of the project, and what is out-of-scope -->
<!-- TODO: Provide examples of how Hyperlight is intended to be used by calling applications and the types of workloads/call-patterns that it is suitable for -->
