# Using FlatBuffers

Flatbuffers is used to serialise and deserialise some data structures.

Schema files are used to define the data structures and are used to generate the code to serialise and deserialise the data structures.

Those files are located in the [`schema`](../src/schema) directory.

Code generated from the schema files is checked in to the repository , therefore you only need to generate the code if you change an existing schema file or add a new one. You can find details on how to update schema files [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html).

## Generating code

Two tools are required to generate the code:

* [flatc](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_using_schema_compiler.html) - the FlatBuffers schema compiler for all languages except C.
* [flatcc](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc) - the FlatBuffers schema compiler for C.

Follow instructions in the links above to build/or install the tools. On Windows you can use vcpkg via `just install-flatbuffers-with-vcpkg:`, this will install vcpkg and then install flatc which can thenls be found at `..\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\tools\flatbuffers\flatc`.

Once you have the tools installed, you can generate the code by running as follows:

```console
flatc -r -o .\src\hyperlight_host\src\flatbuffers\generated\ .\src\schema\guest_error.fbs
flatc -n -o .\src\Hyperlight\flatbuffers  .\src\schema\guest_error.fbs
flatcc.exe -a -o .\src\HyperlightGuest\include\flatbuffers\generated .\src\schema\guest_error.fbs
```
